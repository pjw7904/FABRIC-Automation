    "For building a single-site FABRIC Slice that mirrors the setup of a modern data center network for experimentation. This is accomplished through the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Building a folded-Clos topology. The library used for this purpose builds a traditional folded-Clos setup with a 1:1 oversubscription ratio, resulting in a rearrangably nonblocking network.\n",
    "2. Installing the FRRouting implementation of BGP-4 as the network control-plane on the folded-Clos topology.\n",
    "3. Tuning the BGP-4 implementation to be compliant to RFC 7938 - Use of BGP for Routing in Large-Scale Data Centers.\n",
